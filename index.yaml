    description: Use this service to securely store your solution's tables. This service
      collaborates with many other services as either a destination for data or a
      source of data. A Kafka Connector Service for instance, can only be deployed
      if attached to an IRIS database. On the other hand, a Live Aggregation Service
      needs an IRIS database as the source of the live data to aggregate.
